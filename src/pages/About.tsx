          </h1>
          <p className="text-xl text-muted-foreground max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
            We are a team of passionate young engineers who looked at the real estate landscape and saw a system 
            ripe for change. We saw the frustration of homebuyers navigating a maze of middlemen and the challenge 
            for builders to connect with genuine customers efficiently. The process was fragmented, costly, and 
            lacked transparency.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-muted-foreground max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed mt-4">
            We knew technology could bridge this gap. From this vision, GROUPGAINS was born.
